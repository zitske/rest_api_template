# REST API Template

This project serves as a mockup for building RESTful APIs using Node.js. It provides a basic structure and boilerplate code to help developers quickly set up and start working on their API projects. The template includes essential configurations, middleware, and examples to streamline the development process.

## Features

- Modular and scalable project structure.
- Pre-configured middleware for common tasks (e.g., logging, parsing, error handling).
- Example routes and controllers for quick reference.
- Environment-based configuration management.
- Ready-to-use scripts for development and production.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Configure environment variables in the `.env` file.
4. Start the development server with `npm run dev`.

## Requirements

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
